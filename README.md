<h2>Personal Notes</h2>
<p>Arknights operator database website.</p>
<p>This is my first ReactJS project.</p>
<p>Completely new to Github as well.</p>
<p>This project was really just a way to keep my brain active over summer, I have no intention of completing this.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other good databases out there already.</p>
<p>Outfits page and resources page might load slowly and lag due to images.</p>

<h2>Sources I Used</h2>
<p>Icons from Google Icons.</p>
<p>A majority of the assets used are from here, https://github.com/ArknightsAssets/ArknightsAssets. If the owner of this repo doesn't want me using it, give me a dm on discord.</p>
<p>Below is a list of all the sources I used for operator data, as well as general design inspiration:</p>
